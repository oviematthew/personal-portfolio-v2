## Mastering Next.js App Router: Best Practices for Modern Web Apps

### Next.js 13+ introduced the App Router, a file-system based routing system that encourages server components, nested layouts, and a clearer separation between server and client code. The App Router helps build scalable, high-performance React apps when used with Next.js server and edge features

## File-based routing

### Create routes under the `app/` directory. Files and folders map directly to routes

```text
app/
  page.js            # /
  about/
    page.js          # /about
  blog/
    page.js          # /blog
    [slug]/
      page.js        # /blog/:slug
```

### Use colocated files (e.g., loading.js, error.js, page.js, layout.js) to control behavior for a route segment

## Layouts

### Layouts provide persistent UI across nested routes (navigation, footers, sidebars). Place a layout.js (or .jsx/.ts/.tsx) at a route segment to wrap its children

```jsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Navbar />
        {children}
        <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Keep layouts small and composable so they can be reused across multiple routes

## Loading & error UI

### Place loading.js to show skeletons or spinners while server rendering/fetching. Use error.js to handle rendering errors for the segment

## Example

```jsx
// loading.js
export default function Loading() {
  return <div className="loader">Loading…</div>;
}

// error.js
export default function Error({ error }) {
  return <div className="error">Something went wrong: {error.message}</div>;
}
```

## Metadata API

### Use the metadata export (or generateMetadata) to configure SEO per route

```js
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Home | MySite',
  description: 'Welcome to my site',
};
```

### This gives you per-route control of titles, descriptions, Open Graph, and other head tags

## Server and client components

### By default, components in the App Router are server components. Add "use client" at the top of a file for client-side interactivity

```jsx
// ToggleButton.jsx
"use client";
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function ToggleButton() {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(false);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setOn((s) => !s)}>
      {on ? 'On' : 'Off'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Prefer server components for rendering and data fetching when possible, and only opt into client components for UI that requires browser APIs or stateful interactivity

## Best practices

### Keep layouts modular and focused — compose small layouts rather than one large global layout

### Separate server and client responsibilities. Fetch data in server components and keep UI logic in client components

### Use loading.js and error.js to provide clear feedback during fetches and failures

### Leverage the Metadata API for SEO and social sharing metadata at the route level

### Co-locate CSS/modules and small components with the route that uses them for easier maintenance

## Wrap-up

### The App Router provides a clean architecture for scalable Next.js apps. Favor server components for performance, use nested layouts for structure, and keep client components minimal and focused to achieve a fast, maintainable codebase
