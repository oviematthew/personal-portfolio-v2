    "longDescription": "I built a modern, fully responsive website for Bedge Pictures — a wedding and engagement photography brand using Next.js for its performance, flexibility, and built-in routing and image optimization features. The site is structured with the App Router and includes a blog, a curated collection of wedding stories, a digital product shop, and a full-screen image gallery to showcase high-resolution photography. I chose Next.js to ensure fast loading, SEO-friendly pages, and the ability to scale easily with future content. I used Markdown files to manage blog posts and wedding stories because it allows for a clean, version-controlled content workflow without the overhead of a CMS. This setup makes it easy to update or write new posts directly from a developer environment while keeping the codebase lightweight and fast.The contact form is custom-built and features secure submission using Nodemailer with SMTP credentials and Google reCAPTCHA to prevent spam. I also utilized both Vercel and Google Analytics for deep performance and engagement insights. Additional features include support for Next theme for dark/light themes based on user preferences, GSAP animations for subtle motion effects, and a separate WooCommerce on the subdomain for his digital shop. The entire platform is optimized for both mobile and desktop experiences, reflecting the polished, story-driven aesthetic of the brand.",
